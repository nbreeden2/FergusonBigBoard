I have two jumpers on the backside of my PCB, these were there when I purchased the PCB:

U73 - 2716 - Character Generator ROM
Jumper for pins 24(Vcc) to 21(Vpp) 
The 2716 requires +5 on 21(Vpp) in normal operation.
Assumption is Pin21 was floating in the bpard layout.

Trace Cut U10-12 to U11-3
Jumper U11-3 to U11-14(Vcc)
In the manual I downloaded on the "CRT DISPLAY GEN." schematic page this change is hand drawn in the schematic. As there is no correlation between the manual I downloaded and the PCB I have this makes me wonder of this was a common mod.
