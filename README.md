Documentation and files for the Ferguson BigBoard single board computer
Files and documentation from my BigBoard work.

These files accompany the videos at https://youtu.be/K9SL5NfVGII

Board-Mods.txt  -  Documents the two bodge wires I have on the backside of my BigBoards PCB.

IC-Power.png  -  Documents the power pins of some of the ICs on the PCB.

IC-Layout.png  -  Layout of the PCB showing the IC types and locations.

SIO2-RS232-Config.png  -  Consolodation from the users manual for setting up RS-232.
  
MicroCornucopia  -  Collection of Micro Cornucopia user magazines that covered the BigBoard.
  
jumpers.png  -  I/O connections and Jumper configurations
  
BodgeWires.prg  -  Documents the bodge wires on the PCB I have.
  
SIO2-BAUD-Crystal.png -  Documents the use of either a 5.0688MHz or 4.9152MHz crystal for BAUD rate generation listing the deviation from standard BAUD rates. I'm using a 4.9152MHz crystal as it gives exact timing for 19200 BAUD.

DiskImages.zip  -  I have not tested these. Contains images of 8-inch floppy disks for the Big Board. I see what looks like CP/M on them which would make sense.

Added 4 schematic images. Each is suitable for printing on 11x17 pages.
